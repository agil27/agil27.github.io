title: (Working Project) Self-supervised facial expression recognition with multi-task learning
site: http://agil27.github.io/

Recently, constrastive learning method has proved to be successful in many computer vision tasks. We propose a novel self-supervised facial expression recognition (FER) framework with a facial landmark auxiliary task to facilitate the performance of FER model. 

We also propose a FER-specific augmentation by warping the images with mapping the corresponding Delauney triangles to create high-dimension embeddings with rich semantic information with regards to the facial units.

I'm still working on this project.
