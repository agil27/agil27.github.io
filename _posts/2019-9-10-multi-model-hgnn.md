In this project, we devised a novel modality-attentional block to enhance the hypergraph neural network (HGNN)'s performance on the task of affective computing, which is supposed to predict a valence and arousal level from multi-modal physiological signals. By blending the intermediate hyperedge features, we report an augmented performance compared to the SOTA results.

We also introduce a hand-crafted feature to help the model focus on the individual difference.
